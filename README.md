🌱 AgriVision: AI-Powered Real-Time Crop Health Monitoring 🌾
AgriVision is an advanced AI-driven solution designed to address critical challenges in modern agriculture. Developed by Team Synergy Squad at K J Somaiya Institute of Technology during the Code Odyssey Hackathon, this platform uses artificial intelligence (AI) and cutting-edge drone imagery to offer real-time insights into crop health. By enabling early detection of pests and diseases, AgriVision empowers farmers to take timely, precise, and environmentally sustainable actions, ultimately improving crop yield and reducing the need for harmful chemical interventions.

📋 Problem Statement
Agricultural productivity is significantly affected by pests and diseases, leading to considerable crop losses annually. Traditional pest management techniques often rely on broad-spectrum chemical applications, which can be both inefficient and harmful to the environment. AgriVision leverages AI and drone technology to revolutionize pest and disease management by offering farmers real-time data and actionable insights that allow for more targeted and sustainable interventions.

🎯 Objectives
🕵️ Early Detection: Leverage high-resolution drone imagery and sensor data to detect early signs of pest infestations and crop diseases with high accuracy.

⏰ Real-Time Alerts: Provide farmers with immediate notifications upon detection of issues, enabling prompt and effective intervention.

🌿 Precision Solutions: Recommend eco-friendly, data-driven interventions, such as precision spraying or the introduction of natural predators, to mitigate crop health risks.

🌱 Minimize Crop Losses: Promote sustainable agricultural practices by minimizing pesticide usage, reducing environmental impact, and ultimately reducing crop losses.

💡 Solution Overview
AgriVision employs a comprehensive solution that integrates artificial intelligence, drone technology, and real-time analytics to optimize crop management:

AI Model: The solution utilizes a deep learning-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), trained on extensive labeled datasets of crop images, to identify early-stage diseases and pests with remarkable accuracy.

Drone & Sensor Imagery: High-resolution imagery from drones provides real-time monitoring of crop health, enabling precise identification of areas needing attention.

Real-Time Alerts: Upon detection of crop health anomalies, the platform generates immediate alerts with tailored recommendations for eco-friendly interventions.

Web Application: Farmers can access an intuitive web app, which presents a comprehensive dashboard with key metrics such as crop health status, historical trends, and weather forecasts.

Weather Integration: The platform integrates real-time weather data, enabling farmers to make more informed decisions regarding their crop management activities.
